 # i3-find-or-open
-This repo provides a command-line tool: `i3-find-or-open` that can find a window by regex in your i3wm instance, and display it, or execute any command if it is not open.
 
-It is intended to help you bind keys that will reliably show you a window, whether or not it is open already, but technically it is capable of showing you any window (which is uniquely identifiable by either title or class), or running an arbitrary command if it is not open.
